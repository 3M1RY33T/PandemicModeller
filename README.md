# Pandemic Modeller

This project is developed with Java and JavaFX, using Eclipse IDE.
 
The pandemic modeler project presents the interface to the user in order the handle simulation parameters, such as:
- Population Size,
- Infection Rate,
- Recovery Time,
- Immunity Levels (1 to 5),
- Simulation Speed.

The program takes these parameters, and “models” a simulation of a virus spreading in the population according to 
the parameters given by the user. Each person is represented by a moving dot in a sumulation panel, their color 
decided by their  immunity level, infected status (red if infected) and mortality (black), in which state the 
dot is also stationary.

I've personally taken great interest developing this project, and I found it very interesting to watch a virus spread
through a population, and I've tried the application over and over again with different parameters. It's both fun to
watch the simulation, and it also demonstrates how quickly viruses can spread and how dangerous they can be.
